# Guardlytics
This project analyzes guard scheduling, patrol activity, incident response, and shift performance using real-world-style data from a private security company. Built with Python and Seaborn/Matplotlib, it uncovers patterns in guard punctuality, patrol completion rates, response times, and incident trends across multiple sites and shifts.
